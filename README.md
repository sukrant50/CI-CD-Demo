## Create a new React project

### Use create-react-app

Note that this project will not be up to date in terms of structure as dependencies, in comparison to the original Create React App repo was is used to generate the code for this repo.

So you may prefer to generate a fresh app using the command below from the [Getting Started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) guide.

```sh
$ npx create-react-app my-app
$ cd my-app
$ yarn start
```

Then add the docs and CI setup based on this React Quickstart template repo.

### Create project from React Quickstart template

## Documentation

To learn how to use this project and see how a React project works - see the [About](/docs/template-notes/about.md) page of the template's notes.

See also my [React Router Quickstart](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/react-router-quickstart) project.

<!-- TODO On your copy of this template project, you can delete the lines above, but docs linked after that are still reusable and worth keeping. -->

To install, run and deploy the app, see this project's docs:

## License

Released under [MIT](/LICENSE) by [@MichaelCurrin](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin).

<!-- TODO remove this line when creating a project from this template -->

This project is based on the template from the React CLI. I have added my own docs, the deploy flow and made very minor changes to the app.
